# Time-series
üìà Time Series Analysis This repository focuses on Time Series Analysis techniques used to analyze temporal data for forecasting, anomaly detection, and trend understanding. It includes implementation of key methods using Python libraries such as pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, and prophet.
Here‚Äôs a concise and professional **GitHub README description for Time Series Analysis**. You can copy-paste and edit it as needed for your repo:

### üîç Techniques Covered:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for time series (trend, seasonality, stationarity)
* **Decomposition** using additive and multiplicative models
* **Smoothing Techniques**

  * Moving Average
  * Exponential Smoothing (SES, Holt, Holt-Winters)
* **ARIMA / SARIMA / SARIMAX**

  * Auto ARIMA for hyperparameter tuning
* **Facebook Prophet** for flexible modeling
* **LSTM-based forecasting** (optional advanced deep learning model)
* **Anomaly Detection** in time series using:

  * Rolling statistics
  * Z-score method
  * STL decomposition residuals
  * Isolation Forest / DBSCAN (on temporal features)

---

### üìä Libraries Used:

* `pandas`, `numpy`
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
* `statsmodels`, `pmdarima`
* `prophet` (by Facebook/Meta)
* `scikit-learn`
* `tensorflow` / `keras` *(for LSTM if used)*
